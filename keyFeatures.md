# Key Features

- <b>Concurrency</b> - It's the idea that different tasks can be performed independently and simultaneously. Each task doesn't wait for other task to finish before starting their work

- <b>Garbage Collection</b> - Garbage Collector automatically manages memory, makeing it easier for dev's to write code without having to worry about memory management.
- <b>Static Typing</b> - It means that variables are explicitely declared with a specific type and the type of variable cannot be changed during the lifetime. This will help catch erros at compile time and improve the overall reliability of the code
- <b>Light Weight</b> - Go routines take only 8kb and you can have thousands of them
- <b>Fast Compilation</b> - It has a fast compiler that can quickly build large program, making it suitable for building scalable applications.
- <b>Zero dependencies</b> - Go does not rely on any external libraries or framework. This simplifies the development process and reduce the risk of issue caused by missing on incompatiable dependencies.
- <b>Built-in support for testing</b> - Go includes built-in support for writing and running tests, making it easy to test and verify code.
- <b>Strong community</b> - Go has a strong and active community of devs who contribute to the language and it's ecosystem. including libraries and tools.
